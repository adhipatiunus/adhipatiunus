### Annyeong hamnida, Na neun Adhi imnida!



- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working with numerical simulation for fluid mechanics (mostly)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning software engineering best practice, algorithm and data structure, and numerical analysis.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my MultiphysiX repo, an open source multiphysics simulation designed to be robust, compact, and can be tailored to user's need.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with data structure, mostly neighbor search algorithm for particle because the naive implementation took too long to calculate.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about algorithmic strategy, computational math and physics.

- âš¡ Fun fact: A sucker for turn based game, if you play Othercide it's a plus :)))
- âš¡ Hobby: Learning new language (programming and spoken), doing challenging problems you probably skipped on your textbook.
