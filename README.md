### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**adhipatiunus/adhipatiunus** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ I'm currently working with numerical simulation for fluid mechanics (mostly)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning software engineering best practice, algorithm and data structure, and numerical analysis.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my MultiphysiX repo, an open source multiphysics simulation designed to be robust, compact, and can be tailored to user's need.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with data structure, mostly neighbor search algorithm for particle because the naive implementation took too long to calculate.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about algorithmic strategy, computational math and physics
- ğŸ“« Contact me on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-adhipatiunus-932119157/
- âš¡ Fun fact: A sucker for turn based game, if you play Othercide it's a plus :)))
